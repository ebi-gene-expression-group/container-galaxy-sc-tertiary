| Workflow | Description | Analysis areas |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Atlas-Scanpy-CellBrowser | Retrieves data from Single Cell Expression Atlas for a given accession, filters, normalise, clusterise, marker genes and calculate dimensional reduction with Scanpy. Visualise interactively with UCSC CellBrowser | C DR DE IV |
| Atlas-Seurat-CellBrowser | Retrieves data from Single Cell Expression Atlas for a given accession, filters, normalise, clusterise, marker genes and calculate dimensional reduction with Seurat. Visualise interactively with UCSC CellBrowser | C DR DE IV |
| SC-Atlas-Production | Filtering, normalization, clustering, marker genes and dimensionality reduction used to process every dataset shown in the Single Cell Expression Atlas release 5 and 6 | C DR DE |
| HCA-Scanpy-CellBrowser | Retrieves data from Human Cell Atlas for a given accession, filters, normalise, clusterise, marker genes and calculate dimensional reduction with Scanpy. Visualise interactively with UCSC CellBrowser | C DR DE IV |
| Atlas-Scanpy-SCCAF | Retrieves data from Single Cell Expression Atlas, preprocess and clusterise with Scanpy at two different resolutions and search for best clustering with SCCAF after batch correcting. | C DR DE BC |
| Atlas-Scanpy-SCMap | Retrieves data from Single Cell Expression Atlas, preprocess and clusterise with Scanpy at two different resolutions and maps cells against SCMap pre-filled index. | C DR DE CT |
